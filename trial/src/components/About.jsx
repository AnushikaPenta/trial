         We allows users to share rides with minimal deviations from their routes. Features
          include dynamic cost-splitting, eco-friendly ride preferences, and in-app communication 
          for easy coordination. Users can rate rides for trust and reliability, and the app ensures
           safety with identity verification and GPS tracking. Advanced scheduling options and multi-stop ride
            sharing make it flexible for both daily commuters and occasional travelers. This fosters cost savings, 
            reduces carbon footprints, and promotes a community-driven travel culture.
